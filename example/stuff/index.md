TITLE Stuff... and Things...
NAV Stuff

This is an index page. If you look at its source (`stuff/index.md`), it demostrates how you can have the nav text ("Stuff") be different from the title text. This can be useful if, for example, you have a long title that should be abbreviated in the navbar to save space.

So the main point of index pages is for categories. Here are example pages in the "Stuff" category:

* [Thing1](thing1)

* [Thing2](thing2) (doesn't exist)
